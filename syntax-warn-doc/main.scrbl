@title[#:style '(toc)]{Syntax Warnings}
@author[@author+email["Jack Firth" "jackhfirth@gmail.com"]]

This library includes forms and functions for working with
@warn-tech-definition{syntax warnings}. A syntax warning is a
compile-time source code annotation meant to draw attention to
potential defects. Syntax warnings can be used to point out bad
code style, sub-optimal constructs, excessively verbose code, or
use of deprecated features. Additionally included in this library
are the @exec{raco warn} and @exec{raco fix} commands for finding
and fixing warnings, and the @hash-lang[] @racketmodname[racket/base/warn]
language which provides many forms in @racketmodname[racket/base]
with warnings attached in various ways.
